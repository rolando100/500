			“There is no doubt that the Game has its dangers. For that very reason we love it; only the weak are sent out in paths without perils … our mission is to recognize contraries for what they are: first of all as contraries, but then as opposite poles of a unity…
		</p>

		<p>
		The artistically inclined delight in the Game because it provides opportunities for improvisation and fantasy. The strict scholars and scientists despise it – and so do some musicians also – because, they say, it lacks that degree of strictness which their specialties can achieve.” – The Master [1]
		</p>

		<p>For some, sports seem entirely without purpose [2, 3]. However, for others, like me, life without sports would be unthinkable. Raised with a strong academic tradition, and fortunate to be a part of one of the world’s best educational communities, I increasingly found myself challenged by perspectives that considered my dedication to sports as a trivial if not vulgar pursuit.
		</p>

		<p>I founded the Andover Sports Analytics Club to improve the experience of student athletes and non-athletes that share my passion for sports, by leading explorations into how sports can complement traditional scholarly pursuits, and examining the role it plays in realizing society’s highest purposes [4].
		</p>
		
		<p><i>Sports Matters</i> aims to support this mission by making our resources more easily accessible to club members, and helping us reach sport enthusiasts beyond the Andover community so they too can delight in the Game.
