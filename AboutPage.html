		<p>
			“There is no doubt that the Game has its dangers. For that very reason we love it; only the weak are sent out in paths without perils … our mission is to recognize contraries for what they are: first of all as contraries, but then as opposite poles of a unity…
		</p>

		<p>
		The artistically inclined delight in the Game because it provides opportunities for improvisation and fantasy. The strict scholars and scientists despise it – and so do some musicians also – because, they say, it lacks that degree of strictness which their specialties can achieve.” – The Master [1]
