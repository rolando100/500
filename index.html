		<h1 id="h1Blog1Title"> Top MLB hitters make their own luck, but not the way you might think </h1>

		<hr>

		<p> There are almost half a million high school baseball players in America, but only about 5% will play on a college team [1, 2]. Of that 5%, only 10% will be drafted by an MLB team, and of all minor leaguers, only 10% will ever get drafted into the majors [3]. MLB players are the best of the best, but there are a LOT of them.
		</p>

		<img src="Golf.jpg" width="800" height="600">

		<p> MLB teams carry about 40 players in a roster, and there are 30 teams, so that’s over 1,000 top-tier players [4]. Surprisingly, only about 10 players on the roster get to bat on a regular basis, so that means around 300 across the whole league [5]. Now, one would think these players would be the best of the best of the best! Yet every year, there are only 10 players across all 30 teams that can claim a spot in the MLB Top 10 Home Run leader board. Who are they? Are they really special? If so, what does it take to be this special? What does it take to be a Top 10 Home Run Hitter in the MLB?
		</p>

		<img src="youhavetoplay.jpg" width="900" height="500">

		<p> Since only about 10 players on the roster get to bat on a regular basis, if a player is not part of the starting batting rotation, his chances of hitting a lot of home runs that season is near zero. The more games a player plays, the more chances at bat, and the more likely he is to start adding home runs to his tally. The chart above plots the career home runs versus number of games played for the Top 100 All Time (the first 100 in the 1000 group) [6]. The highest home run totals belong to those players with the most games played. The series have a positive correlation with an R2 of 0.3542. Games played do not tell the whole story, but it suggests that it maybe a material factor in the unusual performance of Top 10 hitters.
		</p>

		<img src="homerungraph.jpg" width="900" height="500">

		<p>In the past 26 years only 108 distinct players have claimed a Top 10 spot. This is remarkable given that every year everyone starts at 0, and there are at about 300 starters playing at least 160 regular season games every year. Also, a major league player is expected to play less than 6 years before retiring, so new challengers arrive every year, and the game can be hard on the body, especially for hitters. The graph above compares the Home Run count of Top 10 hitters against a random sample of MLB batters around the same period. It makes a high confidence case that Top 10 performance is unlikely to be the result of random variations.
		</p>

		<p>Moreover, 57 of the 108 Top 10 hitters managed to claim a Top 10 spot multiple times during the period examined, and 16 of these players made the cut more than 4 times! Also, about half of the players that make the list once, will make the list again. Some do it the very next year, while a few have done it up 6 times in a row! This suggests that many Top 10 players have the ability to accomplish the extraordinary year in and year out. So, what could they be doing differently?
		</p>

		<img src="streaks2.jpg" width="900" height="700">

		<p>Well, one thing some are doing differently is taking more risk. There are 44 players in the Top 10 Home Run list that also made the Top 10 Strikeout list during the same period. Analyzing the number of times a player has appeared in the Home Run list against the number of times he appeared in the Strikeout list one can find a positive correlation with an R2 of 0.308. This suggests that some of these players may be stepping up to the plate with a ”home run or go home” mentality. This may indicate that Top 10 hitters are more willing than the average player to swing for the fences. Again, this does not tell the whole story, but it suggests that a risky batting strategy maybe a material factor in the unusual performance of Top 10 hitters. So, what else could they be doing differently?
		</p>


		<img src="cheaters.jpg" width="700" height="700">

		<p>Sadly, there is large number of cheaters among the most successful and most consistent Top 10 Home Run hitters. Of the 16 players that had more than 4 appearances in the Top 10 list during the 1992-2017 period, 9 have been caught cheating. That is more than half! Interestingly, of the 7 that remain, almost half of them also made several appearances in the Top 10 Strikeout list.
		</p>	

		<p>So, what does it take to be a Top 10 Home Run Hitter in the MLB? It seems that embracing RISKY strategies is the likely answer. Risk of getting struck out a lot, and risk of getting caught cheating. So, are Top 10 players the Best of the Best, or the Worst of Best?
